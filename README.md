# MyGPSDiary

A little project I'm working on to learn and explore the possibilities with Android Studio.

The main goal of this app is to save locations that the user wants with: 
  - a name and note of the location, 
  - along with the date and time of when it was saved, 
  - and the latitude and longitude coordinates.

This app uses Firebase authentication and database.
